# Exercise 1 - The occasionally cheating casino

In a casino they use a fair die most of the time, but occasionally they switch to a loaded die. The loaded die has a probability $0.5$ to show number six and probability $0.1$ for the numbers one to five. Assume that the casino switches from a fair to a loaded die with probability $0.05$ before each roll, and that the probability of switching back is $0.1$. The probability to start a game with the fair die is $0.9$.
