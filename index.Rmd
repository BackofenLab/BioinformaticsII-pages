# Details

Exercises contain two parts:

- standard theory and calculation questions 
- programming assignments.

Standard questions can be found on this web page.

Programming assignments are available via Github Classroom. Links to the appropriate programming assignments will be provided in the according exercise sheet.
Not every exercise sheet will have a programming assignment.

Exercises are designed for self-teaching. Every week there will be a exercise session where questions about the current exercise sheet will be answered and discussed. Please check the Bioinformatics II Ilias course page for more information about dates and times.

**Warning**

::: {#note-exp .note-body}

You will find hints in the self learning materials which e.g. include information
about the formulae that you have to use.
However, in the exam we won't provide those formulae. You have to learn them by heart.
